# Project Plan

1. Project setup

   Establish tooling, repo structure, and configuration.

2. Project scoping and features

   Extract explicit requirements from Frontend Mentor documentation.

3. Architectural decisions (as they arise)

   Record notable design decisions only when they become necessary.

4. Thinking in React

   Outline component hierarchy, state ownership, and data flow.

5. Initial static build

   Build the full UI structure without business logic or validation.

6. Events and interactivity

   Wire up state, validation, navigation, and logic.

7. Polish pass

   Accessibility, UX details, responsive refinements, and cleanup.
